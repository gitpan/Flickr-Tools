Flickr-Tools

These modules provide a set of classes that can be used to work with Flickr, using it's REST API, as provided by the Flickr::API.

The object of this set of classes is to take the "raw" interface that the Flickr::API provides and turn it into a more usable set of objects which are easier and faster to use, while providing full access to all the functionality provided by Flickr.

This distribution provides two sets of classes:

-> The Flickr::API::* modules (eg: Flickr::API::Photos, Flickr::API::People) provide a lower-level way to access the information. They essentially get the output from the Flickr::API module and transform in into a cleaner, easier to work with hash. These modules are essentially there to be used by the next set of modules, but they may be used directly if you should wish to do so.

-> The Flickr::* modules (eg: Flickr::Person, Flickr::Photo) provide higher-level access to the information on a photo, person, etc. This is the preferred interface that the common user is expected to use.

STATUS

This is an early release of the distribution and there are only a limited number of methods available at the moment.

Also, this is a "testing the waters" version and while I hope the API of the objects will not change much in the future I cannot make any promises at this time.

Read the TODO file for the plans for the future of this distribution.
